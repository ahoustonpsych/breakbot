BUGS:
- wallboard/slack disconnect = all breaks and lunches lost
- fri feb 23rd, break counts didn't reset from thursday
- lunches aren't saved on !restart
- breakbot can't parse @usernames from the topic (in #livechat)
- !add doesn't respond when the topic is too long (needs error handling)
NEW:
- finish /update endpoint -- pass info to smuj. add support for task "reasons"
    - log whenever /update is hit
- add 10 hours of logs to /logs
- add break queue system
- maybe make max-on-break a factor of the queue sizes
OTHER:
- update db query file to use mysql.format().
- create new tables for punches and commands, with more columns. add "misc" column.
    - punches: if punching out log time punched in. maybe a daysthisweek column but that can be extracted in code.
    - commands:
        - "command type" column, like "break", "schedule", "data check"
        - column in !back representing actual break time - set break time.
        - add column indicating who sent the cmd, and who the cmd affects
- overhaul responses. use _.template() - also push to master
- properly purge empty lunch slots
- update task to check against #livechat topic and update the appropriate list
- save break data when slack dies (also with other crashy events)
- "!task 20 0" - the 0 gets parsed as null, and throws a "no reason given" error. should throw a "no user given" instead.
- format each element from the "data" object separately before any command processing runs
- expand to work with windows, ent, etc.
